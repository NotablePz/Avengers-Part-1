    The Avengers were a team of extraordinary individuals, with either superpowers or other special characteristics.
    Though primarily affiliated with the interests of the United States of America, the group's purpose was to protect
    global stability from inner or extraterrestrial threats. The Avengers were first assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a
    result of the Avengers Initiative, when Loki invaded Earth with his Chitauri army. The team, consisting of Iron Man,
    Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye defeated Loki and went their separate ways for a while.

    After S.H.I.E.L.D. became a defunct agency due to the HYDRA infiltration, the team was no longer an American
    governmental division, therefore becoming an independent and private organization.
